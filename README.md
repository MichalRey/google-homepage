# google-homepage

This project is about creating a web page similar to google's web page when we search something. In this case i am going to use HTML and CSS only. The project is a part of TheOdinProject's course - Web Development 101 (The Front End section). Here's a link to the mentioned course: http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css.
